DriverExercises
===============
#Background#
A set of exercises with the intent of becoming familiar with the Linux kernel. The maybe-final goal is to transfer this knowledge to Android and make a contribution to an open source Android rom (no promises).

A tentative list of exercises include:

1. Writing a simple read-write driver
2. Writing a driver for an IC sensor (exact sensor TBD)
3. TBD

#Starting Environment#
* Ubuntu 14.04, 64-bit
